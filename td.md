## Todo:
  - other states then game
  - adjust ramp collision trajectory
  - allow smooth descent down ramp
  - ramp gap collision detection
  - convert level size to units to make procedural rooms easy
  - improved use of HUD
  - hazard implementation into collision (player hurtbox)

## MOST IMPORTANT:
### Proper GAMELOOP
  1. player enters room from left door
  2. n waves of enemies spawn (diff types)
  3. player kills using proj or mel (every enemy drops orbs?)
  4. orbs? are a currency to purchase minor upgrades (+10 health, +5 defense)
  5. boss altar counts the num of orbs? player has gotten since entering room
  6. at threshold the altar glows
  7. player can interact with it and spawn a boss
  8. boss drops a boon? which is a major upgrade change to the player functionality (longer dash, bigger projs)
  9. player enters new room (repeat 1-8)
  10. every 3-5 rooms (random?) player enters shop to spend orbs?
