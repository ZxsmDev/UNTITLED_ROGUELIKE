## OVERVIEW

**SEVER** is a room-based 2D action roguelike built in HTML Canvas and vanilla JavaScript.

Each run places you inside a procedurally assembled room. Your job is simple:

Clear henchmen.  
Eliminate the target.  
Advance the sector.

---

## DESIGN PILLARS

### 1. Speed Over Sprawl
No sprawling map.  
No backtracking labyrinth.

Combat rooms. Escalation. Choice nodes. Boss.

Tight, replayable loops.

---

### 2. Aggression Is Rewarded
Standing still gets you killed.

The system rewards:
- Mobility
- Precision
- Controlled risk

---

### 3. Builds Over Branches
Player power comes from:
- Temporary run modifiers
- Synergistic upgrades
- Trade-offs, not linear growth

---

### 4. Escalation Is the Story
Each floor grows harsher:
- Faster enemies
- Denser rooms
- Modifier stacking

The system adapts to efficiency.

---

## CORE LOOP

> Enter Run → Clear Combat Room → Choose Reward → Escalate Difficulty → Face Boss → Extract → Permanent Unlocks

### Per Room

1. Enter sealed combat arena  
2. Survive waves or eliminate targets  
3. Room locks until cleared  
4. Select one of 2–3 upgrades  
5. Proceed to next node  

### Run Ends When

- Health reaches zero  
- Final boss defeated  
- You voluntarily extract (rare mechanic)  

Runs are designed for **15–30 minutes max**.

---

## PLAYER MECHANICS

### Movement

Built for responsiveness and flow.

- **Dash**
  - Fast, short invulnerability window
  - Directional
  - Core survival mechanic

- **Double Jump**
  - Air correction tool

- **Ground Sprint**
  - High-risk positioning tool

Movement remains the most polished system.

Combat difficulty comes from positioning, not stat inflation.

---

### Combat

Fast. Clean. High consequence.

#### Primary Attack
- Melee combo chain
- Cancel into dash
- Short recovery window

#### Secondary Ability
- Ranged or utility skill
- Limited charges or cooldown

#### Ultimate
- Charged by damage dealt or taken
- Screen-clearing effect
- High risk, high reward

---

## RUN STRUCTURE

Each run consists of:

### 1. Sector Entry
- Basic enemies
- Minimal modifiers
- Establish build direction

### 2. Escalation Layer
- Elite enemy variants
- Environmental hazards
- First synergy spike

### 3. Distortion Layer
- Stacked room modifiers
- Faster spawns
- Mini-boss encounter

### 4. Sector Boss
- Pattern-heavy fight
- Designed around dash mastery
- Tests build coherence

## SYSTEMS & PROGRESSION

### In-Run Systems

| Description                                  |
|----------------------------------------------|
| Player health                                |
| Currency gained per room                     |
| Run modifiers (buffs/debuffs)                |
| Global difficulty scaler                     |

---

### Upgrade Types

- Flat stat boosts  
- Conditional damage (e.g., bonus after dash)  
- On-hit effects  
- Movement alterations  
- Risk modifiers (high damage, low health builds)  

Build depth comes from stacking interactions.

---

## ENEMY DESIGN

Enemies are simple individually, dangerous in groups.

Types include:

- **Chaser** – closes distance rapidly  
- **Sniper** – slow windup projectile  
- **Suppressor** – area denial  
- **Splitter** – divides on death  
- **Shield Unit** – directional blocking  

Each enemy pressures a different player habit.

---

## BOSS PHILOSOPHY

Bosses are not HP sponges.

They test:

- Dash timing  
- Spatial awareness  
- Build viability  

Bosses escalate patterns over phases.

No cutscenes.  
Minimal downtime.  
Immediate reset on death.

---

## META PROGRESSION

Between runs, players unlock:

- New upgrade pools  
- Weapon variants  
- Starting bonuses  
- Cosmetic changes  

Meta progression increases **variety**, not raw power.

Skilled players can win early.

---

## VISUAL & AUDIO DIRECTION

### Visuals

- High contrast  
- Strong silhouettes  
- Minimalist arenas  
- UI integrated into world space  

Runs must remain readable at high speed.

---

### Audio

- Impact-heavy combat sounds  
- Subtle escalating music layers  
- Audio cues for dash timing and elite spawns  

Clarity over ambience.

---

## TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

Designed for scalability within web constraints.

- HTML Canvas  
- Vanilla JavaScript  
- Centralized GameManager  
- State-driven architecture  
- Entity-based modular structure  
- Object pooling for performance  
- Deterministic room generation  

No external engine.  
No heavy frameworks.  

Optimized for portfolio visibility and code clarity.
